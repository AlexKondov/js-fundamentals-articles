is one of the most popular programming languages today. It runs in the browser, it runs on the server, it’s on mobile devices, desktop apps and probably refrigerators as well. Even if we take the more exotic examples out of the picture, if you are dealing with any sort of web development you will be writing or dealing with JavaScript at a certain point.\nMany web developers claim that they know JavaScript because they can write code which runs. The thing about JS is that you can start coding in a month and then master the language for the rest of your life. If there are no errors and nobody’s complaining why should you need to learn more?\nWell, I was one of the people who claimed to know the language well. I was writing an app with AngularJS and Node a few years ago and I was pretty confident in my skills. Slinging functions left and right, I believed that I had the JS language conquered.\nSo when an interviewer asked my to explain what a Closure is I found myself stunned. I mean I kind of knew what it is. I knew it had something to do with callbacks and I was using callbacks all the time back then (I didn’t know of Promises then) but somehow I couldn’t find the words with which to explain what it is and how it works.\nA failed JavaScript interview was the most humbling and educational experience in my development career. Since then I devoted more than a year and a half for reaching a higher dan in JS and decided that it’s high time I shared it with the world. Starting from one of the most common JavaScript interview questions:\nAbout This Book\nTo say that there are a lot of resources about learning JavaScript would be an understatement. There is an abundance of articles, courses, books that can teach you the basics of the language and get you going. However, after you pass that initial hurdle and feel comfortable writing code you can end up confused and unsure of what to do next.\nThere are a lot of frameworks and tools that can help you develop complex web applications by abstracting away some of the complexity of the language. Jumping into a framework immediately after learning the basics can leave a gap in your knowledge. This book is meant to fill this gap by introducing the specifics of the JavaScript language in a short and compact manner - no complex terms, straight to the point.\nMy goal is to be able to present specifics of the JavaScript language in an easy to digest manner, so future developers can be more comfortable in their knowledge of the fundamentals. I've taken the time to read a lot of content on those topics and extract the essential information from each one, so you won't have to do your own research.\nThere are courses and lectures that can present those topics in amazing detail and get to the nits and bolts of each one. There are hours and hours if in depth explanations and exercises. The articles in this book are meant to be used more as a reference and pre-interview refreshers as you can see from their length - each one can be read in about ten minutes.\nWho is this book for\nThis book is meant for people who know how to code and are familiar with the JavaScript syntax but are still in the beginning of their career. The contents here will be perfect for you if you've just finished a course for beginners and are now looking for directions about what to do next. It's good to get a good grasp of the fundamentals concepts of the language before you start learning a framework. Understanding the JavaScript specifics will uncover some of the magic of the language and you will feel more comfortable using it because you know what happens underneath.\nYou have already heard of people being frustrated because of the inner workings of the language. Well, the fundamentals will never change, so you better get a good solid grasp of how JavaScript works or you will be one of those people in the future. JS is one of the most widely adopted languages so an investment in learning its fundamentals is guaranteed to pay off.\nThere are people have no desire to deeply understand how JavaScript works and just want to build things. While the modern tools abstract away a lot of the complexity, those tricky questions about scope and closures will still creep into your code interviews. Being profficient with React is a good competitive advantage but failing a question about the event loop can turn the tide in a negative direction.\nIn short - beginners and junior developers who want to get a better understanding of the language.\nWho is this book not for\nIf you have just started coding, I'd suggest to leave those topics for a bit later. Get more comfortable with the language, write a couple of simple projects to get accustomed to the syntax. When you have some experience behind your back and have gained a bit of confidence then it's time to dive a bit deeper into the confusing parts.\nIf you are already an experienced developer, then this read won't give you much value. You have probably read enough on those topics and have encountered problems in your work that have lead you to get a good understanding of the language. The most benefit would be to use the chapters as reference if necessary.\nIn short - anyone who doesn't fall into the previous category.\n"},"scope/":{"url":"scope/","title":"Scope","keywords":"","body":"Scope\n\nScope is the visibility of functions and variables in the different parts of your code during runtime.\n\nIn other words, the scope of a variable or a function is the part of the code in which it is available. Working with variables and scope comes intuitively to most developers. We have some mental models that help us understand when something can be off limits.\nTo master the JavaScript language we must be looking to build on top of those existing mental models and go into the specifics. While I'm sure that every developer would do fine writing code without a deep understanding of scope, only those who have put in the time to read the small print will be able to avoid all pitfalls and answer the trickiest interview questions.\nTypes of Scope\nIn JavaScript there are three types of scope:\n\nGlobal Scope - variables can be accessed everywhere.\nFuncton Scope - variables can be accessed in the boundaries of the function in which they are defined.\nBlock Scope - variables can be accessed in the block in which they are defined. A block is separated by { and }.\n\nconst global = 'I am global scoped'\n\nfunction fn() {\n    const global = 'I am function scoped';\n    console.log(global); // I am function scoped\n}\n\nfn(); \nconsole.log(global); // I am global scoped\n\nAs you can see in the example, even though the global variable is assigned a different value inside the function, it is only retained in the boundaries of the same function. Outside of it, the variable has a different value  —  the one declared in the global scope. We also won't get an error for using the same variable name.\nconst global = 'global'\nconst anotherGlobal = 'also global'\n\nfunction fn () {\n\n    const global = 'function scoped'\n    console.log(global) // function scope\n    const scoped = 'also function scoped'\n\n    function inner () {\n        console.log(scoped); // also function scope\n        console.log(anotherGlobal) // also global\n    }\n\n    inner();\n\n}\n\nconsole.log(global) // global\nconsole.log(anotherGlobal) // also global\nconsole.log(scoped) // ReferenceError\n\nfn();\ninner(); // ReferenceError\n\nHere we can see that the inner() function will have access to the variables declared in its parent function - fn(). Whenever we need a variable inside a function, the engine will first look for it in the scope of the current function. Then it will go one level up in the function containing it. If it doesn't find it there it will continue to go up until it reaches the global scope. If the variable is not found there we will get a ReferenceError.\nUndeclared variables\nJavaScript won't stop you from using undeclared variables. This means that at any point you can assign a value to a variable without using const, let or var. When you do this the engine will try to look for the variable bubbling up to the global scope. If it doesn't find it there it will create a global variable for you. \nAs a rule of thumb, avoid poluting the global scope. If a variable is meant to be globally used then declare it in the global scope so your intentions can be clear. Otherwise keep it inside the scope it is used in.\nHoisting\nThe hoisting of functions and variables in JavaScript is the reason why we can use some of them before they are actually declared.\ntest(); // ???\n\nfunction test() {\n  console.log('working');\n}\n\nThe code above will log the string \"working\" even though the function is called before it's declared.\nThe common explanation that is given for this behaviour is that function and variable declarations are pulled to the top of their scope. So when you try to access them they have already been declared. To the example above will actually become:\nfunction test() {\n  console.log('working');\n}\n\ntest(); // working\n\nVariables are also hoisted but in a different way. Only the declaration of the variable is \"pulled\" to the top. The value assignment will stay where it is. In other words, we can't access the value of a variable the same way we can call functions.\nconsole.log(test) // undefined\nvar test = 'working'\nconsole.log(test) // working?\n\nThis is how the above code will look after the variables were hoisted to the top:\nvar test;\nconsole.log(test) // undefined\ntest = 'working'\nconsole.log(test) // working?\n\nThis is why we need to be careful when we are using function expressions.\nconsole.log(test) // undefined\nconsole.log(test()) // TypeError: test is not a function\nvar test = function () {\n    console.log('test')\n}\n\nAgain, only the declaration is pulled to the top while the actual assignment of the function as a value will stay where it is. So when we try to call test as a function we will get an error.\nBlock Scope\nIn ES6 we got two new variable declaration keywords - let and const. The main difference between them and let is that variables declared with the ES6 keywords are block scoped. This means that they are available only in the code block they were defined in. A code block is separated by curly braces.\nSince we are discussing scope, it's important to note that variables created with let or const are not hoisted. This means that they definition is not pulled to the top like variables declared with var.\nconsole.log(test) // ReferenceError: test is not defined\nconst test = 'working'\n\nOne way to make sure that your code is free from reference errors is to make sure that you are using only let and const for variable declaration.\nCompilation\nNow that we understand the concept of hoisting we will look into the internals of the language and understand how it actually works. The V8 engine increases performance by compiling JavaScript to mchine code before executing it. What happens in the process of compilation is that the engine makes multiple runs through our code. In one of the early runs it will declare all functions and variables. So when the code is executed they will already be defined.\nSo, hoisting is actually a mental image to help us illustrate why we can access functions and variables before they are defined. The common explanation of hoisting is just a picture of how code is reorganized before execution. When the engine is actually executing our code our function and variable declarations are no longer there at all. They have already been declared in a previous run.\nConclusion\nThe concept of scope comes intuitively to developers, but in order to achieve mastery in a language we must be aware of its specifics. The things that we need to keep in mind as JavaScript developers are:\n\nUndeclared Variables\nBlock Scoped Variables\nHoisting\n\n"},"closures/":{"url":"closures/","title":"Closures","keywords":"","body":"Closure\nYou’ve undoubtedly been using closures for quite a while now for they have a variety of applications. Every time you’ve added a callback for an event handler you’ve used the magical properties of the closure.\nI’ve come across different one sentence explanations for them but the one that clicked the most for me was given by Kyle Simpson:\n\nClosure is when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope.\n\nThis explanation can be a bit overwhelming at first so we will break it down piece by piece and see that closures are no dark magic after all.\nWe won’t be going into detail about scope in this article (there will be a separate one on this topic) but it’s essential to know what it is in order to understand how the closure works. Scope is practically the part of the code in which certain variables and functions are contained. In JavaScript every function creates a new scope and it’s variables and passed arguments will be available only inside of it.\nIf you declare a variable inside a function it won’t be available outside of it. But we can also define functions inside of other functions which will have a scope on their own inside of them. Now the special thing about those nested functions is that they can access their parent’s variables.\nIt’s not that special to be honest, since every function defined in the global scope can access the variables in it, but I’m getting to something here. Those nested functions that we mentioned can access their parent function’s scope but they themselves can’t be called from outside of the parent function. Unless we expose them somehow.\nWe can expose that inner function so it can be used in the global scope. Great! Now we can call it and use it as we wish. But let’s imagine that this exposed inner function actually references one of the variables in it’s parent’s scope. Will that be a problem? No, of course it won’t because it’s a Closure!\nClosures are exposed nested functions\nI am not sure if this is the best definition that can be given for closures, but it captures the essence of the term well enough. Closures are exposed functions which can access the scope of their parent even if we call them from the outside. Do you get that explanation with the lexical scope that we mentioned earlier now?\nfunction person(name) {\n  return {\n    greet: function() {\n      console.log('hello from ' + name)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet alex = person('alex');\nalex.greet(); // hello from alex\nconsole.log(alex.name); // undefined\nconsole.log(name); // will throw ReferenceError\n\nHere we define a person function that takes a single parameter name. It returns an object which has a greet function as one of it’s properties. As we now know, this exposed greet function will still have access to its parent’s arguments even when we call it like this. So even that the name variable is not explicitly defined in it’s scope greet will fetch it from its parent’s because it is a closure.\nNot too difficult to understand and you have probably taken advantage of this behaviour numerous times. Before I started reading about closures I never thought of all the dark magic that is going on behind the curtain so I can achieve encapsulation and use modules.\nWhoa, whoa… Modules? Encapsulation? Those came out of the blue.\nModules and encapsulation with Closures\nOne of the first things that I learned when I started diving deeper into the JavaScript maelstrom is that there are a lot of complex sounding words that have a really practical explanation to them. Modules and encapsulation are the perfect examples of such terms. We’ll use the same strategy and break down each one to understand it thoroughly by starting with encapsulation.\nEncapsulation is one of the basic principles of programming. Those who have studied OOP are familiar with the concept but for those who are not — this is essentially a hiding mechanism which allows us to keep some of our data private. Often we don’t want to expose all the contents of a function to the global scope, we want most of it to remain private and untouchable.\nThis is where closures are really handy. We can utilise their power to access the parent scope even when they are called outside of it to achieve proper encapsulation. We can have many functions and variables inside our parent function and by using a closure we can expose to the world only the functionality that we desire.\nWith closures we can define a public API for our function and keep everything else private.\nNow that we have encapsulation covered, we just need to put it in practice. The implementation of this concept in JavaScript is done using the module pattern.\nModules\nIn ES6 we have better file-based modules which we can use with the import and export keywords, but it’s important to note that they are just syntactic sugar over what we are about to see.\nfunction Person(firstName, lastName, age) {\n  var private = 'this is a private member';\n\n  return {\n    getName: function() {\n      console.log('My name is ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName);\n    },\n    getAge: function() {\n      console.log('I am ' + age + ' years old')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet person = new Person('Alex', 'Kondov', 22);\nperson.getName();\nperson.getAge();\nconsole.log(person.private); //undefined\n\nThis is a fairly simple example to demonstrate how we can keep some of the function’s data private. We can have other nested functions and even use them in the exported ones but not expose them.\n\nfunction Order (items) {\n  const total = items => {\n    return items.reduce((acc, curr) => {\n      return acc + curr.price\n    }, 0)\n  }\n\n  const addTaxToPrice = price => price + (price * 0.2)\n\n  return {\n    calculateTotal: () => {\n      return addTaxToPrice(total(items)).toFixed(2)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst items = [\n  { name: 'Toy', price: 14.99 },\n  { name: 'Candy', price: 7.99 }\n]\n\nconst order = Order(items)\nconsole.log(order.total) // undefined\nconsole.log(order.addTaxToPrice) // undefined\nconsole.log(order.calculateTotal()) // 27.58\n\nIn this slightly more realistic example we have a function which returns an order object. The only exposed function is calculateTotal. It has a closure over the Order function which allows it to use its variables and passed arguments. It also hides what is actually happening when you are calculating the order total, allowing you to add a shipping cost or something else in the future.\nWeird parts\nNow, JavaScript has it’s weird parts. In fact some of them are so weird that they can be the cause of serious headache and restless nights of debugging. Closures are no different when we don’t use them properly.\nThe following code is often given at JavaScript interviews with the task to guess it’s output.\nfor (var i = 1; i \nAll we’re doing here is looping from 1 do 5 and setting a timeout to print the current number after a certain amount of time. Common sense says that this code will output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right?\nTo our surprise the above code logs the number 6 five consecutive times in the console. If you do this loop without the setTimeout you won’t be having any issues, because the log will be executed immediately. But apparently queueing up this operation in time is what causes the flaw.\nWe expect that every setTimeout call will receive it’s own copy of the i variable, but what happens is that it accesses it from it’s parent’s scope. And because they are queued the first log will happen 1 second after it was queued. When those 1000 milliseconds pass the loop has long finished and the i variable rests with the value of 6 assigned to it.\nWe understand the problem but how do we fix it? setTimeout will look for the i variable in the global scope, which leads to it not printing the number we want. We can manipulate that by wrapping the setTimeout in a function and passing the variable that we want to log in it. This way the setTimeout function will access it from it’s parent’s scope instead of the global one.\nfor (var i = 1; i \nWe are using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) and pass the number to log to it. An IIFE is a function that we call immediately after defining it and are often used in situations such as this — when we want to create a scope. This way each function will be called with it’s own copy of the variable, meaning that when the setTimeout runs it will access the proper number. So using the example above we will get the result of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 that we are looking for.\nClosing thoughts\nThis article captures the essence of closures but there is more to it to learn and more edge cases to ponder upon. If you want to dabble further into the depths of closure dark magic I strongly suggest Kyle Simpson’s book on Scope & Closures.\n"},"coercion/":{"url":"coercion/","title":"Coercion","keywords":"","body":"Coercion\nCoercion is the term that is used for unexpected type casting in JavaScript. Often when you are working with data you will need to transform it from one data type to another — something that every developer does on a daily basis. Coercion refers to those not-obvious type casts that happen as a side-effect of different operations.\nMost people see this as something that is here to make their lives harder. Some see it as a flaw in the design of the language and try to avoid it. However, I suggest we take a deeper dive, understand how it works and embrace the JS chaos. Unless you want to write your own JavaScript engine, chances are you will have to work with coercion. Even if you decide to avoid it as much as possible, it’s essential to know what to work around and how.\nOf course, if not handled properly coercion can be destructive and lead to unwanted bugs and complications in your codebase. But for the time being, let’s focus on another point of view — that coercion is necessary in order to simplify our code and get rid of unnecessary boilerplate that would make our code messier.\nStrings and Numbers\nLet’s start easy — how can we combine numbers and strings? How do we make a string out of a number and vice versa? The simplest and often used way to cast a number to a string is by using the + operator.\n14 + \"\" // \"14\"\n\nWhenever you are using “+” or “-” the values that you are adding or subtracting must be of the same type. Now in the above example they obviously are not. So what will happen is that JS will try to even them out — in this case cast our number to a string and then add them together. In other words every “+” expression that involves a string will result in a string.\n42 + \"0\" // \"420\"\n\nWe can concat strings using “+”, but what will happen if we use “-”? It can be used only on numbers, so once again, JS will cast the values to be of the same type — this time numbers.\n\"42\" - 7 // 35\n\"42\" - 0 // 42\n\"42\" - \"9\" // 33\n\nOkay that’s not that hard, but there is always a catch. Let’s try adding two arrays together and see what happens:\n[\"alex\", \"sam\"] + [\"jon\", \"mary\"] // \"alex,samjon,mary\"\n\nWait, what just happened? Now, whenever you use the “+” operator, the values will concatenate if one is already a string or they will be cast to strings if possible. Therefore, you get the two arrays’ string representation which are then added together. It’s logical once you understand it, but it can lead to disappointments when it happens unexpectedly.\nAnother interesting case is what happens when we use the “-” operator. As I mentioned earlier, it is reserved only for numeric types, so once again, the useful JavaScript language will cast the values to numbers (if possible) and then execute that operation on the resulting values.\n[3] - [1] // 2\n[\"alex\", \"sam\"] - [\"jon\", \"mary\"] // NaN\n\nJavaScript just tries to save you some time whenever it can. Some developers expect it to behave like other languages and that leaves them unhappy with the results. The more you get used to the JS specifics the less bugs you will introduce in your code.\nBooleans\nThis has undoubtedly caused trouble even for more experienced developers. Boolean coercion is often used in if statements, loop checks, ternary and logical operators. Whenever you’re using one of those, if the variable in it is not a boolean it will be coerced to one. More importantly, the result of a logical expression, for example is not necessarily a boolean but the value of one of the two operands that are used. Maybe an example would be better:\nconst a = 100\nconst b = \"test\"\nconst c = null\na || b // 100\na && b // \"test\"\na || c // 100\na && c // null\nb || c // \"test\"\nb && c // null\n\nLet’s break down what’s going on here. Developers coming from other languages might expect this to return true or false when they use it in conditional checks, for example. In fact what you get is the value of one of the operands.\nWhen you use the || operator, if the first value casts to true you will get that value returned. Otherwise, you will always get the second one. In the case of && you will always get the second value if they are both coerced to true. If the first one casts to false then you will get it’s value returned.\nRight now you’re probably thinking about the flaws of the JavaScript language and considering your career choices, but let me just remind you that this is the exact same behavior you get in Python and Ruby (surprise). Their inheritance implementation also behaves in a similar matter to prototypical inheritance but this is a different topic.\nSo, why is this useful? Something that can often be seen is initializing variables like this:\nfunction greet (name) {\n    name = name || 'visitor'\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)\n}\ngreet() // Hello, visitor!\n\nHere we’re using this exact behavior to check if a value is missing and assign another one if it is. You can see this in many codebases. As a side note, in ES6 you can define default values directly in the function arguments in order to avoid checking all the passed values in the beginning of the function.\nEquality\nWhen talking about coercion we must also mention the equality operators and common misconceptions about them. The popular explanation is that == compares values without checking types and === compares both values and types. While this is a simple way to explain what’s going on it’s not entirely true.\nAs we mentioned earlier, some operations cannot be run on values of different types, so behind the curtains JavaScript will use coercion to make our lives easier. Whenever we compare two values using ==, JavaScript will use coercion to cast the values to be of the same type. On the other hand when we use strict equality === JS won’t type cast the values (meaning that if they are of different types they’re not equal).\nSimply put, == is comparison which allows coercion, === is comparison without coercion.\n42 == \"42\" // true\n42 === \"42\" // false\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, coercion is something that you will encounter on a daily basis as a JS developer, so understanding it is crucial. The information in this article is enough to get a general understanding but there is a lot more to learn about the nature of the helpful language that is JavaScript.\n"},"this-keyword/":{"url":"this-keyword/","title":"The \"this\" Keyword","keywords":"","body":"The \"this\" Keyword\nAnother topic that has been the reason for a lot of discussion is the this keyword. More specifically — it’s unexpected behavior at times. About an year ago, a colleague of mine asked me to have a look at her JS code because she was having strange bugs. As a Java developer just starting to play around with JavaScript she had done the mistake of thinking she could understand the language before actually studying it — like many people do.\nHow many other developers going into JS have problems with this, I do not know but I expect the number to be quite high. In fact this is probably the easiest concept of JavaScript that you have to understand. If I have to explain it with my own words I would probably spit out something in the lines of:\nThe this keyword does not refer to the function in which it is used or it’s scope. It refers to the object on which a function is being executed and depends entirely on the call-site of the function.\nLet’s create a really basic example to illustrate what is going on:\nfunction testThisKeyword() {\n    console.log(this) // [object Window]\n}\ntestThisKeyword()\n\nLet me give you another one which will question your understanding on JavaScript even more:\nfunction testThisKeyword() { \n    console.log(this.name) // Alex\n}\nvar name = 'Alex'\ntestThisKeyword()\n\nWhat? How on earth does that input the name variable? It’s not even created in the function’s scope! This is one of the reasons that developers get really sad. It just doesn’t work the way you expect it to. Contrary to popular belief there is no black magic going on underneath. What is happening here is that the name variable is declared in the global object, therefore it can be accessed as a property on it. If we look at the call-site of the function we will see that we are not implicitly calling it on an object so this will reference the global object.\nThe this keyword gets automatically defined in the scope of every function and it’s binding happens in three ways — default, implicit and explicit. The example with the standalone function invocation has already shown you how the default binding works. Something to have in mind is that that is the fallback binding if another is not specified. Let’s get into more details about the implicit and explicit binding.\nImplicit Binding\nconst person = {\n  name: 'Alex',\n  greet() {\n    console.log('Hey my name is ' + this.name)\n  }\n}\nperson.greet() // Hey my name is Alex\n\nIn order to understand what value this will hold you need to look at where it is called. Not the function in which it is used but the call-site. In this example the owner or containing object is the person object. A trick that I like to use is to look at the left side of the function call. The object that is standing before the dot is what the this keyword will be bound to.\nSomething to have in mind is that this binding can get “lost” if you start passing functions as reference. Even if you are referencing a function that is a property on an object, if you call it separately it won’t have the binding you expect and it will use the default binding. This is why the only thing that matters for this is the call-site of the function. A better and more in-depth example of this can be read in Kyle Simpson’s book on this and object prototypes, so I won’t go into details here.\nExplicit Binding\nIn the example of implicit binding we have to use an owner object in order to achieve the binding that we want. But what if we don’t want to have a reference to the function on the object or we are unable to mutate it? There is a solution to explicitly say to a function what object it should use for this — using functions such as call, apply and bind. Using explicit binding is so common that those two functions are available from the function prototype, however there are differences between them.\nThe call function allows you to pass in the object to which the this keyword should be bound to. It also allows you to pass arguments for the function as additional parameters.\nfunction greet() {\n    console.log( this.name );\n}\n\nvar person = {\n    name: 'Alex'\n};\n\ngreet.call( person, arg1, arg2, arg3, ... ); // Alex\n\nThe apply function is similar to call with the difference that the function arguments are passed as an array or an array-like object.\nfunction greet() {\n    console.log( this.name );\n}\n\nvar person = {\n    name: 'Alex'\n};\n\ngreet.apply( person, [args]); // Alex\n\nThe bind function is a little bit different than the first two. It creates a new function that will call the original one with this bound to whatever was passed in.\nfunction greet() {\n    console.log( this.name );\n}\n\nvar person = {\n    name: 'Alex'\n};\n\nvar greetPerson = greet.bind( person );\ngreetPerson(); // Alex\n\nConclusion\nA little bit earlier in the article I told you that those were the main bindings for the this keyword. Well I may have lied to you, because there is also a binding that is happening when you use the new keyword. However, I’m planning on writing a small article on that so I’ll skip the explanation for now.\n"},"new-keyword/":{"url":"new-keyword/","title":"The \"new\" Keyword","keywords":"","body":"The \"new\" Keyword\nIn my previous article https://hackernoon.com/understanding-javascript-the-this-keyword-4de325d77f68 I vaguely mentioned the new keyword and that it creates a binding for this. In object-oriented languages new is used whenever you want to instantiate a class.\nvar dog = new Dog();\n\nWhat usually happens is that the constructor function of the class is called and it instantiates the new object. Even though JavaScript’s syntax is pretty much the same, using new causes a different behavior under the hood.\nThere are no constructors\nFirst off, we don’t necessarily need a class in order to create an object. In JavaScript we can use a function for that purpose. Constructor functions are just regular functions that happened to be called with the new keyword in front of them. You could argue that there are no constructor functions — only constructor calls, because practically any function can be called to create an object. It doesn’t have to be part of an object or class or defined in any special way.\nThere are a few steps that the constructor call goes through, but we’ll focus only on those that matter for the current discussion:\nA new object is created\nthis is bound to the new object\nUnless the function returns its own object, the call will return the constructed object\nfunction Person(name) {\n    this.name = name\n}\nvar person = new Person(\"Alex\")\nconsole.log(person.name) // Alex\n\nSummary\nTo wrap things up, this is not a difficult concept. The main thing to wrap your head around is that any function can be called as a constructor and it creates a binding for this upon doing so.\n"},"value-vs-reference/":{"url":"value-vs-reference/","title":"Value vs Reference","keywords":"","body":"Value vs Reference\nA big step to becoming a good developer in general is understanding how variables can sometimes contain a value and in others - a reference. This will save you a lot of debugging time and help you write better code.\nData Types\nThe data types in JavaScript fall into two broader categories. Strings, numbers, booleans, null and undefined fall in the primitives category. The remaining - arrays, objects and functions fall into the second category which we will call objects.\nWe will not go into the details of each single data type. Instead we will take a more general look at primitives and objects and understand how each group stores its values.\nPrimitives\nPrimitives are fairly easy to understand. Each time you create a variable it will have its own copy of the value that is passed in.\nconst num = 42;\nconst str = \"Hello!\";\n\nEach variable contains its own copy of the given value. In other words we can say that each variable points to a specific place in memory which contains its value.\nSo if we try to assign it to another variable:\nconst a = 7;\nlet b = a;\nb++;\n\nconsole.log(a, b); // 7, 8\n\nWhen we create the variable b it gets its own copy of the value contained in a. So when we increment b, the value of a will stay the same. Even though they contain the same value (the number 7), the value that they store it saved in different places in memory. So modifying one of them does not modify the other.\nLet's take a look at how comparison works.\nconst a = 7;\nconst b = a;\n\na === b; // true\n\nconst c = 7;\nconst d = 7;\n\nc === d; // true\n\nWhen we compare variables containing primitives, we compare their values. We find what they are storing, we retrieve it from memory and compare that.\nObjects\nA common cause of headache for beginners is the expectation that objects should behave the same way primitives do. When I started I couldn't understand why two objects with identical structure would not be equal to each other in particular cases. And I couldn't understand why they would be in others.\nconst obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };\nconst obj2 = { a: 1, b: 2 };\n\nThose two objects are completely identical, so judging by what we know from primitives we would expect them to be equal to each other. But to our surprise, comparing them does not return the result we expect.\nobj1 === obj2; // false\n\nWhenever we are creating an object (array, object or function) we will store its value in a particular place in memory and each object will have its contents stored in a different place.\nBut we already know that primitives behavve in a similar manner. So the problem does not come from how we store objects but how we compare them. When we try to compare two objects we are not comparing their contents but the place in memory that they are pointing to.\nThis si why two objects with identical structure are not equal to each other - they reference different places in memory.\nThis is where it gets tricky. Since objects contain a reference to a place in memory we must be really careful of how we use them.\nconst obj1 = { a: 1 };\nconst obj2 = obj1;\n\nobj1 === obj2; // true\n\nNow the comparison returns true because both variables point to the same place in memory. When we assign obj2 to be equal to obj1 we are not giving it a separate copy of the object but a reference to the same one. They are sharing the same one. So changing one will also affect the other.\nconst obj1 = { a: 1 };\nlet obj2 = obj1;\n\nobj2.b = 10;\n\nobj1; // { a: 1, b: 10 }\nobj2; // { a: 1, b: 10 }\n\nWhile primitives are fairly easy to understand, the improper understanding of objects and references will lead to errors.\nA fairly simple example is mutating a value that is passed to a function\nconst obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }\n\nfunction mutate(someObject) {\n  someObject.c = 3\n  // Do something with the object\n}\n\nobj // { a: 1, b: 2 }\nmutate()\nobj // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n\nThis is the reason you want to be extra careful when you are mutating an object, especially one you don't control.\nHowever, you may still want to make a copy of some object and extend it or change its values. Using the new object spread operator\nyou can do something like this.\nconst obj1 = { a: 1 }\nconst obj2 = { ...obj1 }\n\nobj1 === obj2 // false\n\nBy using the spread operator we create a new object containing the values of obj1.\nWhen we compare them we see that they have different references, so we can safely work with the second one.\nThis technique is often used to create a new object and add or change a property.\nconst obj1 = { a: 1 }\nconst obj2 = { ...obj1, b: 10 }\nconst obj3 = { ...obj1, a: 2 }\n\nIn this example, obj2 will have an extra property on it, while obj3 will modify the existing property a without modifying the original object obj1.\n"},"promises/":{"url":"promises/","title":"Promises","keywords":"","body":"Promises\nPromises are a  relatively new feature to JavaScript and can be a bit hard to grasp at first. Essentialy, a Promise represents a future action. Something that will happen in the future but you are not yet sure what will be the outcome of it. It may happen or it may fail, but you do not yet know that. Therefore we can say that a Promise has three possible states:\n\npending\nsucceeded\nfailed\n\nWhen we construct a promise we need to provide it with a function that takes two parameters - ressolve and reject. Of course, they can be called any way we want but this is the accepted naming convention. Those two values are functions which we can call from our Promise to signal if it succeeds or fails.\nconst mood = 'happy'\n\nconst goingOut = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  if (mood === 'happy') {\n    resolve()\n  } else {\n    reject()\n  }\n})\n\nThe way we consume a promise is to specify what will happen after it succeeds or fails.\ngoingOut\n  .then(() => /* The promise resolved successfuly, we take some action */)\n  .catch(() => /* The promise got rejected, so we can handle the error */)\n\nPromises can also pass values when they resolve or are being rejected.\nconst goingOut = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  if (mood === 'happy') {\n    resolve('We are going out.')\n  } else {\n    reject('We are staying home...')\n  }\n})\n\ngoingOut\n  .then(msg => console.log(msg)) // We are going out.\n  .catch(err => console.log(err)) // We are staying home...\n\nPromises provide a clean API when you need to chain a few operations together. We can call a function inside then and if the returned value is a promise we can chain it to another then.\nconst pickDestination = (msg) => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    // Do something here...\n    resolve(`${msg} We are going to a restaurant.`)\n  })\n}\n\ngoingOut\n  .then(pickDestination)\n  .then(msg => console.log(msg)) // We are going out. We are going to a restaurant.\n\nIf we want to return a resolved or rejected promise we can use the .resolve and .reject functions on the Promise object directly. The pickDestination function will then look like this.\nconst pickDestination = (msg) => {\n  return Promise.resolve(`${msg} We are going to a restaurant.`)\n}\n\nPromises are used mostly for asynchronous operations. Tasks such as a request to a service that you are not sure exactly when are going to be completed or if they will succeed.\nES7 - async/await\nIn ES7 we can use the async/await syntax for asynchronous operations. The benefits of the new keywords is that our asynchronous code will look more synchronous and we can handle errors using simplle try/catch blocks.\nasync function willGoOut = () => {\n  try {\n    const goingOut = await goingOut()\n    const message = await pickDestination(goingOut)\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.log(err) // We will be staying home.\n  }\n}\n\nEach function in which you want to take advantage of await must be specified as async. Another thing to be aware of is that each await will pause the execution of your program. Chaining a few awaits one after another can lead to slow execution.\nIn cases in which you need multiple requests resolved, which are not depending on each other, you can use Promise.all\nconst [ value1, value2 ] = await Promise.all([\n  firstRequest(),\n  secondRequest()\n])\n\n"},"prototype-and-inheritance/":{"url":"prototype-and-inheritance/","title":"Prototype and Inheritance","keywords":"","body":"Prototype and Inheritance\nInheritance in JavaScript is something that has been discussed for a long time. I started learning JS by taking a bootcamp-y course that was aimed to give us the practical knowledge we’d need in our daily coding challenges. We were told how the bad JavaScript language lacks OO patterns and how we have to break our backs to make them work. The instructors quickly went through prototype and how we can mimic class behavior with it without going in depth with how it’s working (because they didn’t understand it either).\nSo I was left with this feeling that JS is a crippled language because it lacks the abilities of the other languages to create classes out of the box so we had to do all kinds of crazy shenanigans to make it fit into what we believe was right. Then I started thinking, if it’s so hard to learn, leads to illogical behavior and there are so many roadblocks, maybe prototypes are not the right approach. After reading Kyle Simpson’s book about prototype I made the conclusion that a lot of people blame JavaScript for their own inability to learn new concepts. JS has it’s specifics and I’ll go through how prototypical inheritance works and what are it’s problems.\nPrototype\nAlmost all objects in JavaScript have the prototype property. By using it and more specifically the prototype chain we can mimic inheritance. The prototype is a reference to another object and it is used whenever JS can’t find the property you’re looking for on the current object. Simply put, whenever you call a property on an object and it doesn’t exist, JavaScript will go to the prototype object and look for it there. If it finds it it will use it, if not it will go to that object’s property and look there. This can bubble up all the way to Object.prototype before returning undefined. This is the essence of the prototype chain and the behavior that sits behind JavaScript’s inheritance.\nfunction Animal(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n}\n\nAnimal.prototype.sleep = function() {\n    console.log(this.name + ': Zzz...');\n}\n\nfunction Dog(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n}\n\n// Create a reference for the prototype\nDog.prototype = Object.create(new Animal());\n\nDog.prototype.makeSound = function() {\n    console.log(this.name + ': Woof woof!');\n}\n\nvar dog = new Dog('Lassie');\ndog.makeSound(); // Lassie: Woof woof!\ndog.sleep(); // Lassie: Zzz...\ndog.missing(); // Throws Error\n\nThe above code can be overwhelming when you first encounter prototypes, let’s break it down. We’ll start from line 20 — with the new keyword we create a new object using the Dog constructor function on line 9. That gives us an object with a name property and a makeSound function bound to it’s prototype. When we call makeSound it is executed in the context of the current object (dog) and we get the correct output.\nWhen we call sleep() it obviously doesn’t exist on Dog, so it goes up the prototype chain to Animal. It finds it there and calls it. On the last line we call the missing() function which is not defined anywhere. It will go all the way up the prototype chain to Object.prototype and since it won’t find it there it will throw an error.\nAs you see we haven’t used the word class anywhere, we haven’t defined a class that extends the base one or something like that. This is more of a delegation than inheritance. Every object has this prototype property which points to another object which should be delegated responsibility in case the property we’re looking for is not found on the current one. There’s nothing fancy about that, the object is just delegating responsibilities to it’s superior whenever it can’t handle the task.\nShadowing\nIf we look through the prism of inheritance once again we know that we often need to override properties and methods. In prototypical inheritance this is called shadowing.\nfunction Animal(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n}\n\nAnimal.prototype.sleep = function() {\n    console.log(this.name + ': Zzz...');\n}\n\nfunction Dog(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n}\n\n// Create a reference for the prototype\nDog.prototype = Object.create(new Animal());\n\nDog.prototype.makeSound = function() {\n    console.log(this.name + ': Woof woof!');\n}\n\nDog.prototype.sleep = function() {\n    console.log(this.name + ': Overriding Zzzz....');\n}\n\nvar dog = new Dog('Lassie');\ndog.makeSound(); // Lassie: Woof woof!\ndog.sleep(); // Lassie: Overriding Zzzz....\n\nWhat we’re doing here is creating a property with the same name on Dog’s prototype, so when we call it it will find it there and stop the prototype chain bubbling. As you can see, we’re not using the override keyword anywhere, we’re just declaring the property on the Dog object so JavaScript won’t start looking for it in the prototype chain.\nProblems with Inheritance\nIf you’ve read my previous articles with the same label, here is the point in which I tell you that JavaScript always has it’s specifics and not understanding them correctly can give you a big headache. At some point you may have to use shadowing on a property, but then inside of it call the “parent” function with the same name. While in most other languages you can just use super(), here things are a bit trickier. If you use this approach and call this.sleep() inside of the shadowed function, you will end up calling the same function and the result will be a recursion. Therefore we must think of another way to solve the problem.\nDog.prototype.sleep = function() {       \n  Animal.prototype.sleep();\n}\n\nThis sounds like a good approach at first and it almost is, but if you execute it you will see that you will not get the result you expect because the contextual binding is not correct.\nDog.prototype.sleep = function() {\n  Animal.prototype.sleep.call(this);\n}\n\nBy executing it like this however we call the function on Animal using the contextual binding of the current function. In other words we call Animal’s sleep function using the current Dog’s data, I can’t explain it much simpler than that.\nThe concept of Inheritance\nFor me, one of the hardest things to wrap my head around was the prototype keyword meaning. I was trying to make some mental connection between the word and the process of inheritance until I realized that they really have no connection. What we’re doing is just abusing the prototype behavior delegation in order to mimic inheritance while in fact we don’t have it. In order to give you another example of how our conception of class based hierarchies is different than JS prototypes — I present you the constructor property.\nThis is a property on Object.prototype and it returns the constructor function that created the object that we’re calling this on. Not the name of the function but the function itself. What do you think would happen if we log into the console the constructor property of the dog variable? You probably expect it to return the Dog function, but you will be surprised.\nconsole.log(dog.constructor); // [Function: Animal]\n\nWait what? This is returning the Animal function because it is attached to the Dog property upon object creation. This once again shows that those methods and properties weren’t implemented with OO design in mind.\nES6 Classes\nAs of ES6 you can say that the inheritance hierarchy problems in JavaScript is solved. We got the class keyword together with all other goodies that come with it. We can now define classes, extend them, use constructors and the super keyword to access parent methods without the ugliness of the code above.\nclass Animal {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  sleep () {\n    console.log(`${this.name}: Zzz...`);\n  }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n  constructor(name) {\n    super(name);\n  }\n\n  bark () {\n    console.log(`${this.name}: Woof woof!`);\n  }\n}\n\ndog = new Dog('Lassie');\ndog.bark(); // Lassie: Woof woof!\ndog.sleep(); // Lassie: Zzz...\n\nThis looks a lot better if you’re already familiar with classes. It removed the unnecessary repetition of the prototype keyword, the use of Object.create() and the dark magic that we had to do in order to call a “parent” function. You also have the proper syntax and it’s much easier to understand what is going on. The ES6 code and the prototype code above are more or less doing the exact same thing, but the one of the new standard is times easier to understand.\nNow something that you need to bear in mind is that this syntax is (mostly) just a beautified version of the prototype. It really simplifies the development process by making things easier for people with background in other languages to understand. But something that needs to be considered is that because of that same reason — ES6 classes being syntactic sugar over prototype — there are still some issues.\nBecause the prototype approach is more like delegation rather than real inheritance, “parent” objects are passed as a reference. In other languages, upon creating an object, you get a copy of it’s functionality, including the parent classes. Therefore in JS, a child object can access “parent” functions even if they are created after the child object. This is due to the fact that prototype is just a reference, not a concrete object. It’s a hotline that objects use to find a way out when they are missing a particular property.\nConclusion\nUntil the introduction of “real” classes in ES6, the whole concept of inheritance was messed up and (usually) taught in a wrong manner. Prototypes are more of a delegation tool and they don’t really behave like classes. Now with the modern approach we can pretty much create normal class hierarchies and use understandable syntax for them, but be wary of possible problems that may occur. This syntax is only a beautiful facade for what’s going on inside.\n"},"event-loop/":{"url":"event-loop/","title":"Event Loop","keywords":"","body":"The Event Loop\nYou’ve probably heard that JavaScript is a single-threaded language. You may have even heard the terms Call Stack and Event Queue. Most people know that the Event Loop is what allows JavaScript to use callbacks and promises, but there’s a lot more to it. Without going into too much details we’ll have a high level view of how JavaScript code is actually executed.\nThe Call Stack\nJavaScript has a single call stack in which it keeps track of what function we’re currently executing and what function is to be executed after that. But first — what’s a stack? A stack is an array-like data structure but with some limitations — you can only add items to the back and only remove the last item. Another example is a pile of plates — you put them on top of each other and at any time you can only remove the top one.\nWhen you’re about to execute a function it is added on the call stack. Then if that function calls another function — the other function will be on top of the first one in the call stack. When you get an error in the console you get a long message that shows you the path of execution — this is what the stack looked in that exact moment. But what if we make a request or put a timeout on something? In theory that should freeze the entire browser until it is executed so the call stack can continue? In practice however, you know that this doesn’t happen — because of the Event Table and Event Queue.\nThe Event Table & Event Queue\nEvery time you call a setTimeout function or you do some async operation — it is added to the Event Table. This is a data structure which knows that a certain function should be triggered after a certain event. Once that event occurs (timeout, click, mouse move) it sends a notice. Bear in mind that the Event Table does not execute functions and does not add them to the call stack on it’s own. It’s sole purpose is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue.\nThe Event Queue is a data structure similar to the stack — again you add items to the back but can only remove them from the front. It kind of stores the correct order in which the functions should be executed. It receives the function calls from the Event Table, but it needs to somehow send them to the Call Stack? This is where the Event Loop comes in.\nThe Event Loop\nWe’ve finally reached the infamous Event Loop. This is a constantly running process that checks if the call stack is empty. Imagine it like a clock and every time it ticks it looks at the Call Stack and if it is empty it looks into the Event Queue. If there is something in the event queue that is waiting it is moved to the call stack. If not, then nothing happens.\nHere are a couple of interesting cases. In what order do you think the following code will run?\nsetTimeout(() => console.log('first'), 0)\nconsole.log('second')\n\nSome people think that because set timeout is called with 0 (zero) it should run immediately. In fact in this specific example you will see “second” printed out before “first”. JavaScript sees the setTimeout and says “Well, I should add this to my Event Table and continue executing”. It will then go through the Event Table, Event Queue and wait for the Event Loop to tick in order to run.\nExploits\nAnother interesting example of the Event Loop’s behavior is recursion. Have you ever seen the stack overflow error message? You sometimes get that when you make an infinite recursion but sometimes you actually have a big number of recursive calls that you want to make. There’s a simple yet hacky workaround which will allow you to retain your code structure and still make an absurd amount of calls — wrap your recursion calls in setTimeout.\nInstead calling recursion() (imagine this is the name of your method) directly, you can call setTimeout(() => recursion(), 0). This will avoid the stack overflow because the calls will go through the event table and queue instead of directly piling up on the stack. Try to restrain from using that approach, but it’s a good example of JavaScript’s behavior.\nConclusion\nThere is a lot more going on and this is just the basic explanation of the loop and everything else around it. As much as I wanted to keep this as simple as possible there is no way to explain what the Event Loop does without going into the whole process. Something else to have in mind is that this explanation is in the context of the V8 JavaScript Engine. It’s the engine behind Chrome and is also used in Node.\n"}}}
