<p>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages today. It runs in the browser, it runs on the server, it&#x2019;s on mobile devices, desktop apps and probably refrigerators as well. Even if we take the more exotic examples out of the picture, if you are dealing with any sort of web development you will be writing or dealing with JavaScript at a certain point.</p>
<p>Many web developers claim that they know JavaScript because they can write code which runs. The thing about JS is that you can start coding in a month and then master the language for the rest of your life. If there are no errors and nobody&#x2019;s complaining why should you need to learn more?</p>
<p>Well, I was one of the people who claimed to know the language well. I was writing an app with AngularJS and Node a few years ago and I was pretty confident in my skills. Slinging functions left and right, I believed that I had the JS language conquered.</p>
<p>So when an interviewer asked my to explain what a Closure is I found myself stunned. I mean I kind of knew what it is. I knew it had something to do with callbacks and I was using callbacks all the time back then (I didn&#x2019;t know of Promises then) but somehow I couldn&#x2019;t find the words with which to explain what it is and how it works.</p>
<p>A failed JavaScript interview was the most humbling and educational experience in my development career. Since then I devoted more than a year and a half for reaching a higher dan in JS and decided that it&#x2019;s high time I shared it with the world. Starting from one of the most common JavaScript interview questions:</p>
<h1 id="about-this-book">About This Book</h1>
<p>To say that there are a lot of resources about learning JavaScript would be an understatement. There is an abundance of articles, courses, books that can teach you the basics of the language and get you going. However, after you pass that initial hurdle and feel comfortable writing code you can end up confused and unsure of what to do next.</p>
<p>There are a lot of frameworks and tools that can help you develop complex web applications by abstracting away some of the complexity of the language. Jumping into a framework immediately after learning the basics can leave a gap in your knowledge. This book is meant to fill this gap by introducing the specifics of the JavaScript language in a short and compact manner - no complex terms, straight to the point.</p>
<p>My goal is to be able to present specifics of the JavaScript language in an easy to digest manner, so future developers can be more comfortable in their knowledge of the fundamentals. I&apos;ve taken the time to read a lot of content on those topics and extract the essential information from each one, so you won&apos;t have to do your own research.</p>
<p>There are courses and lectures that can present those topics in amazing detail and get to the nits and bolts of each one. There are hours and hours if in depth explanations and exercises. The articles in this book are meant to be used more as a reference and pre-interview refreshers as you can see from their length - each one can be read in about ten minutes.</p>
<h1 id="who-is-this-book-for">Who is this book for</h1>
<p>This book is meant for people who know how to code and are familiar with the JavaScript syntax but are still in the beginning of their career. The contents here will be perfect for you if you&apos;ve just finished a course for beginners and are now looking for directions about what to do next. It&apos;s good to get a good grasp of the fundamentals concepts of the language before you start learning a framework. Understanding the JavaScript specifics will uncover some of the magic of the language and you will feel more comfortable using it because you know what happens underneath.</p>
<p>You have already heard of people being frustrated because of the inner workings of the language. Well, the fundamentals will never change, so you better get a good solid grasp of how JavaScript works or you will be one of those people in the future. JS is one of the most widely adopted languages so an investment in learning its fundamentals is guaranteed to pay off.</p>
<p>There are people have no desire to deeply understand how JavaScript works and just want to build things. While the modern tools abstract away a lot of the complexity, those tricky questions about scope and closures will still creep into your code interviews. Being profficient with React is a good competitive advantage but failing a question about the event loop can turn the tide in a negative direction.</p>
<p>In short - beginners and junior developers who want to get a better understanding of the language.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-book-not-for">Who is this book not for</h2>
<p>If you have just started coding, I&apos;d suggest to leave those topics for a bit later. Get more comfortable with the language, write a couple of simple projects to get accustomed to the syntax. When you have some experience behind your back and have gained a bit of confidence then it&apos;s time to dive a bit deeper into the confusing parts.</p>
<p>If you are already an experienced developer, then this read won&apos;t give you much value. You have probably read enough on those topics and have encountered problems in your work that have lead you to get a good understanding of the language. The most benefit would be to use the chapters as reference if necessary.</p>
<p>In short - anyone who doesn&apos;t fall into the previous category.</p>
